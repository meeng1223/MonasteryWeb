                  Before 1959 in Tibet, His Holiness Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje established Rigzin Ghatseling Monastery at Buchu in the Kongpo region of Tibet and founded the first Lama Lingpa community. During this period, many accomplished masters, great ngakpas, and fully ordained monks (gelongs) emerged among His Holiness's disciples, and the Dudjom Tersar lineage flourished.

                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  Following the events of 1959, Tibetans lost their homeland and sought refuge in India. During this difficult period of exile and displacement, His Holiness recognized the urgent need to establish a monastery to prevent the degeneration of the Buddha's teachings. To preserve the Nyingma lineage, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama requested Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche Jigdral Yeshe Dorje to serve as the Supreme Head of the Nyingma tradition.
                </p>
                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  Keeping His Holiness the Dalai Lama's request deeply in his heart, Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche resolved to establish a monastery. With the support of the Government of Odisha in acquiring land and the guidance of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, he chose Odisha as the location for Dundul Raptenling Monastery.
                </p>
                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche selected Odisha because, according to the Hevajra Tantra, it is one of the Twenty-Four Great Sacred Places. Odisha is also regarded as the celestial abode of Oddiyana. Kyabje Rinpoche sent a letter to the Tibetan community of Pemako, the sacred region of southern Tibet, explaining his vision to establish a Nyingma monastery and settlement in Odisha and inviting them to join him. Many responded to his call.
                </p>
                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  In 1961, Kyabje Rinpoche bestowed the name Dundul Raptenling upon the monastery established at Camp No. 3 of the Odisha Tibetan Refugee Settlement. Initially, the monastery could accommodate approximately one hundred members of the sangha. A sacred assembly of statues representing the Cho-Long-Trul Sum—Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara, and Guru Padmasambhava—was installed. Troma was placed on the far right and Dorje Drolö on the far left. As in Tibet, many practitioners devoted themselves to meditation retreat.

                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  Under the supervision of Lama Sherab Dorje Rinpoche and Lama Dorje Namgyal Rinpoche, construction of a three-story tsuglagkhang (monastery temple) began around 1969. Due to limited financial resources, the project required another ten years to complete. These same constraints also prevented the monastery from being built exactly according to Kyabje Rinpoche's original design. On February 3, 1979, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama consecrated and inaugurated the newly completed Dundul Raptenling Monastery.
                </p>
                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  Over the years, Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche's sons and grandsons, including Kyabje Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche, Kyabje Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Kyabje Garab Dorje Rinpoche, and many other disciples of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, have helped protect and preserve the monastery and its lineage.

                  Today, the unmistaken reincarnation of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche has appeared as Kyabje Dudjom Sangye Pema Shepa Rinpoche. As foretold in prophecy:
                </p>
                <blockquote className="p-lg bg-cream border-l-4 border-gold italic font-subheading text-subheading text-ink-mid my-xl leading-relaxed">
                  "In his former life, he was Vajradhara Jigdral Yeshe Dorje.<br />
                  In a future life, he will be Sugata Desheg Moepa Thaye.<br />
                  In this present lifetime, he is the ascetic yogi, the crown ornament of the teachings.<br />
                  To you, Sangye Pema Shepa, I supplicate."
                </blockquote>
                <p className="font-body-lg text-body-lg text-ink-mid leading-relaxed">
                  In accordance with this prophetic verse, Kyabje Dudjom Sangye Pema Shepa Rinpoche is the spiritual head and supreme holder of the monastic seat of Dundul Raptenling.

                The monastery is situated at Camp No. 3 of the Phuntsok Ling Tibetan Settlement in Odisha. According to sacred geography, it is surrounded by holy mountains, including the mountain of Vajravarahi to the south and the Three Families of the Victorious Ones to the west.

                Because of its connection to Oḍḍiyāna and its auspicious setting, Dundul Raptenling has become a place where the teachings of the Nyingma tradition continue to flourish.
